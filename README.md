# Welcome to my "Professional Python Programming" Repository 

## Repository Description:  
I have completed a course on Python namely - [___Professional Python Programming___](https://training.devskill.com/Course/ViewDetails/f11e00f3-c1ef-ce20-1ae7-08d52e7664f1). This is the first Python course completed by me where I get introduced about Python and Data Science domain. This repository contains the exercises solutions of several tasks and homeworks of this course. 

### [Basic Python Section](https://github.com/ybg345/DevSkill-Python-Course/tree/master/Basic%20Python):

In this section, I have learned most of the basic things of Python in this course like - `list`, `map`, `lambda`, `set` etc. Along with progression of this course, there was regular homework assignment. You can find the relevant code in this folder. 

### [Web Scrapping Section](https://github.com/ybg345/DevSkill-Python-Course/tree/master/Web%20Scrapping):

I have analyzed the website  - `"http://quotes.toscrape.com/"` using Python's `BeautifulSoup` library. There are two different versions scrapping code - one is single page web scrapping and another is multiple page web scrapping. Both of this version of code can be found in this folder. 

### [Machine Learning Section](https://github.com/ybg345/DevSkill-Python-Course/tree/master/Machine%20Learning):

In this section, I have analyzed a `Salary dataset`. First of all, I have completed data preprocessing step. Then I played with some machine learning algorithm with it like - `Linear Regression`, `Polynomial Regression`, `Support Vector Machine` etc. Relevant code can be found in the folder.   

  
 
_The Journey Begins from here._
